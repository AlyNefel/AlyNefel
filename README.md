👋 Hi, I’m Aly

👀 I’m interested in making the internet a funnier place, one line of code at a time. You know, like a digital comedian! 🎭

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can solve world hunger, or at least improve my snack game. 🍕 If it involves pizza, I’m in!

📫 How to reach me: Send a carrier pigeon! 🕊️ (Just kidding, my email is ali.essoudani@nefel.education. But if you find a pigeon, I’ll still accept that as a valid form of communication!

😄 Pronouns: They/Them (or just “the awesome one”). I respond to both, but “the awesome one” gives me a nice boost of confidence! 😎

⚡ Fun fact: I once tried to build a website to track all my favorite football teams... but I ended up spending hours just watching highlight reels instead! ⚽️📺
